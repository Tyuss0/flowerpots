                <p>The Friendly Flowerpot is a business located in Western Australia.  All of our pots are handmade using quality materials and techniques.  We deliver to anywhere in the world. A sample of our range of pots can be viewed from the Gallery page. Other types of pots or custom-made pots are available upon request.

                 Francie began making her own pots in the early 90's and began selling them to interested friends as a hobby.  Since then, the business has grown and we now have a team of skilled potters working to please our customers.  We're certain that we have just the right pot for you.</p>
